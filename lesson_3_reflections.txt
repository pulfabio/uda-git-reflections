When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are more people working on it. Or when it's finalized and I want to share it with some public.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because a commit might go public before other necessary changes are added.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a sequence of reachable commits within the same repository, it can be used to test new features.
A clone is a copy of a repository either within the same local system or across remote systems. It can be used to import a repository.
A fork is a copy of a repository within GitHub. It can be used to adopt someone else's reposotory and work on it.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It allows us to tell whether the the local and the remote repositories are in sync or not.
Knowing that we can decide whether we have to pull, fetch, merge or push some branches.
