When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When there are more people working on it. Or when it's finalized and I want to share it with some public.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because a commit might go public before other necessary changes are added.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a sequence of reachable commits within the same repository, it can be used to test new features.
A clone is a copy of a repository either within the same local system or across remote systems. It can be used to import a repository.
A fork is a copy of a repository within GitHub. It can be used to adopt someone else's reposotory and work on it.
