What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates a .git file and adds it to the directory. It contains the metadata that makes the repository a repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It might contain all the files in the working directory or only some of them.
All the files it contains will belong to a commit of the repository.
I allows us to choose exatly what files will be included in a commit.
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can add to the staging area only files related to the same logical change.
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
For example when I'm testing a new feature, or when I am creating a differen type (mode, translation, ecc.) of the file.
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I can tell what commits belong to a branch and on the other hand what is not included in it.
