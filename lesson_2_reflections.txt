What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
git creates a .git file and adds it to the directory. It contains the metadata that makes the repository a repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It might contain all the files in the working directory or only some of them.
All the files it contains will belong to a commit of the repository.
I allows us to choose exatly what files will be included in a commit.
